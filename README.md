# Module 14 Challenge - CitiBike NYC Analysis

## [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/morris4358/viz/challenge14_16562756470680/Story1?publish=yes)

## Overview of Project
This project involves using Tableau to analyze data related to a bike sharing program in NYC and create visualizations and a Tableau Story to communicate those findings. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to take a CSV file containing data related to the NYC Citi Bike bike-sharing program (from August, 2019) and to analyze that data and present analysis and visualizations that would help to inform and persuade potential investors considering launching a similar bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Analysis

### Checkout Times

- The following visualization shows the distribution of rides by duration:

![Rides by Duration](https://github.com/morriscomia/NYC_Citibike_Challenge/blob/main/IMAGES/Checkout%20Times.jpeg)

- A remarkable number of trips have a duration of 5 minutes or less, and there are very few trips with a duration of 30 minutes or more.

### Checkout Times by Gender

-Figure 2 shows that the bulk of bike sharing usage is from males during the work week. The frequency of female usage is lower, but follows the same trends with most preferring short rides of about 8 minutes or less. There are still many, but significantly less, rides in the medium 10-20 minute range.


### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour

- This figure shows that the bike sharing service is not only used mostly during weekdays, but also shows peak hours are during 6 A.M. to 10 A.M. and 5 P.M. to 8 P.M., also known as the "rush hour" period. Figure 3 also shows moderate bike share usage on the weekends, mostly during the afternoon. This would be the time most people are going out to shops, visiting the city's park, seeing sights, and more.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

-This Figurevshows that the bulk of bike sharing usage is from males during the work week. Female usage is lower, but follows the same trends with most usage occurring during rush hour on weekdays.


### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

- This Figure shows that the bike sharing service is mostly used by males during the weekdays, and a little less so on the weekends.

## Summary

Provide a high-level summary of the results and

### Future Analysis

Create visualizations for:

* Checkout duration by age with new trip duration format
* Trip duration by user type
* User type by gender
* add lat/long for drop off locations for the most used bikes (show example)

## Recommendation for future data gathering

* Gather data on other bike sharing companies in other cities.
* New York city data may correlate but almost certainly will not directly translate to a mid-western, less dense (in terms of population) city.
* Gather data on startup costs
* Cost of bikes
* * Gather data on cost of bike repairs and revenue per customer to determine business sustainability.
