# Module_14_Challenge
Module 14 Challenge - CitiBike NYC Analysis

## Overview of Project
This project involves using Tableau to analyze data related to a bike sharing program in NYC and create visualizations and a Tableau Story to communicate those findings. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to take a CSV file containing data related to the NYC Citi Bike bike-sharing program (from August, 2019) and to analyze that data and present analysis and visualizations that would help to inform and persuade potential investors considering launching a similar bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. 

## Analysis

### Checkout Times

- The following visualization shows the distribution of rides by duration:

- A remarkable number of trips have a duration of 5 minutes or less, and there are very few trips with a duration of 30 minutes or more.
